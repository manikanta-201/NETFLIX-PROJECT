**Project Summary: Creating a Netflix Website Clone**

For my project, I am developing a Netflix website clone using HTML, CSS, React, and JavaScript. The goal is to replicate the look and feel of the Netflix website, showcasing my skills in front-end development and design.

One of the key aspects of this project is the use of React components. I am structuring the website into reusable components, such as the header, footer, movie list, and movie card. This approach not only makes the code more organized and easier to maintain but also allows for a more dynamic user experience.

In terms of design, I am paying close attention to CSS styling. I am using modern CSS techniques to create a sleek and visually appealing interface. This includes using flexbox and grid for layout, implementing responsive design for different screen sizes, and incorporating animations and transitions to enhance user interactions.

To enhance the user experience, I am also implementing features such as a responsive navbar, a carousel for the movie list, and a modal for displaying movie details. These features aim to replicate the functionality of the Netflix website and provide users with a seamless browsing experience.

Overall, this project is a great opportunity for me to showcase my skills in front-end development and design. By creating a Netflix website clone, I am not only honing my technical skills but also demonstrating my ability to create engaging and user-friendly web experiences.


























# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
